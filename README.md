The code currently committed is just the prototype
of the complete application that is aimed to be built.
It shows the APIs being used and what kind of logic
can be built to accomplish it. Every class mentioned 
under the packages below has a main function as of now
that can be used to run every script created. 

The idea was to built every component mentioned as a 
Spring Service and invoked via a REST controller but that is 
not implemented as of now.

Components 

1. Create an Excel Writer                                                                                 - Package demo\src\main\java\jsonToExcel
